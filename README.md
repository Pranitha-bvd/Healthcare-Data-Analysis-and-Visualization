# Healthcare-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization
## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that analyzes and visualizes the impact of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) using healthcare data from 1995 to 2010. The dataset includes information on health insurance coverage across different states and years. The analysis focuses on understanding the changes in healthcare access and coverage before the ACA was enacted.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from the US Department of Health and Human Services and the US Census Bureau. It includes information on the percentage of people with and without health insurance, categorized by state and year.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: The notebook includes steps to clean and preprocess the dataset, such as removing percentage signs, extracting geolocation data, and converting data types.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: The notebook explores the dataset by examining trends in health insurance coverage across different states and years.
- **Visualization**: Various visualizations are created to illustrate the impact of the ACA, including pivot tables and regional analysis.
- **Statistical Analysis**: The notebook includes statistical summaries and comparisons of different categories within the dataset.

## Requirements
To run the notebook, you will need the following Python libraries:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `plotly`
- `seaborn`
- `re`

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook `Healthcare data analysis and visualisation.ipynb`.
4. Run the cells to perform the analysis and generate visualizations.

## Results
The analysis reveals trends in health insurance coverage before the ACA, highlighting regional differences and changes over time. Visualizations provide insights into the percentage of insured individuals across various states and years.
